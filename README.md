# CORPORATE AUTOMATED PREDICTION ENGINE (C.A.P.E.) Advanced Financial Modeling & Drift Detection System

The Mission: To transition Corporate FP&A from static, backward-looking Excel models to dynamic, forward-looking Python prediction engines.

The Capability: C.A.P.E. utilizes a weighted ensemble of Gradient Boosting machines (LightGBM + XGBoost) to ingest complex operational datasets, automatically detect non-stationary trends, and generate risk-adjusted revenue forecasts. It is designed to strictly eliminate look-ahead bias and flag "Model Drift" before it impacts the P&L.
